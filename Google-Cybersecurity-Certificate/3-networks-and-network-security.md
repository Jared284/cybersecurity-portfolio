## 🌐 Networking Basics

- **Network** – Two or more devices connected to share data.
- **IP Address** – A unique identifier for a device on a network.
- **MAC Address** – Hardware ID burned into network interfaces.

### Network Types:
- **LAN** – Local Area Network (e.g., home, office)
- **WAN** – Wide Area Network (e.g., the internet)
- **VPN** – Virtual Private Network; encrypts data over public networks

---

## 🔌 Protocols You Should Know

- **TCP/IP** – Core communication protocol of the internet
- **DNS** – Translates domain names to IP addresses
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – For accessing web pages (HTTPS is secure)
- **SMTP/IMAP/POP3** – Email protocols
- **FTP/SFTP** – File transfer protocols

---

## 🧰 Network Devices

- **Router** – Connects networks and directs traffic
- **Switch** – Connects devices within a LAN
- **Firewall** – Filters incoming/outgoing traffic based on rules
- **IDS/IPS** – Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems

---

## 🔐 Network Security Concepts

- **Defense in Depth** – Multiple layers of security
- **Least Privilege** – Granting users minimum access needed
- **Segmentation** – Breaking networks into smaller zones to limit breach impact
- **Zero Trust** – Never trust, always verify

---

## 🛠️ Tools for Network Security

- **Wireshark** – Packet analysis tool
- **Nmap** – Network scanning and mapping
- **Firewalls** – Hardware or software to block unwanted traffic
- **SIEM** – Collects and analyzes security events/logs
