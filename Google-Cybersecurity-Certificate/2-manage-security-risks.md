# Course 2: Play It Safe – Manage Security Risks

This course explores how organizations identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks, and introduces important concepts in security frameworks, risk management, and governance.

---

## ⚖️ Risk Management Concepts

- **Cybersecurity Risk** = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
- **Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to acceptable levels.

### Key Risk Terms:
- **Threat** – A potential cause of harm (e.g., phishing attack).
- **Vulnerability** – A weakness that could be exploited (e.g., unpatched software).
- **Impact** – The damage resulting from a successful exploit (e.g., data breach).

---

## 🧰 Risk Management Lifecycle

1. **Identify** – Understand what assets need protection.
2. **Assess** – Evaluate vulnerabilities and threats.
3. **Mitigate** – Reduce risk using controls.
4. **Monitor** – Continuously assess and improve.

---

## 🛡️ Security Controls

- **Administrative Controls** – Policies, procedures, training.
- **Technical Controls** – Firewalls, encryption, authentication.
- **Physical Controls** – Locks, security guards, surveillance.

### Control Types:
- **Preventive** – Stop an attack before it happens (e.g., MFA).
- **Detective** – Alert you when something happens (e.g., IDS).
- **Corrective** – Fix issues after an event (e.g., backups).

## 📚 Security Frameworks

Frameworks help guide security strategy and compliance:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – International standard for information security management.
- **CIS Controls** – Prioritized actions to improve cyber hygiene.

---

## 🔐 Risk Governance

- **Security Governance**: Sets direction for the security program.
- **Security Policies**: High-level documents outlining rules and responsibilities.
- **Compliance**: Meeting legal, regulatory, and organizational standards.

## 🧠 Career Connections

- Risk management is crucial across all cybersecurity roles.
- Understanding governance, frameworks, and controls shows you're thinking like a security pro.
