# Course 4: Tools of the Trade – Linux and SQL

This course explores the use of Linux and SQL as essential tools in a cybersecurity toolkit. It focuses on command-line navigation, file system interaction, and querying databases.

## 🐧 Linux for Cybersecurity

- **Linux** is widely used in cybersecurity for its flexibility, open-source nature, and powerful command-line tools.

### Key Linux Concepts:
- **File System Navigation** – `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
- **Managing Files** – `touch`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`
- **Permissions** – `chmod`, `chown`, `ls -l`
- **Processes** – `ps`, `top`, `kill`
- **Searching** – `grep`, `find`, `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`
- **Piping and Redirection** – `|`, `>`, `>>`

### Practical Use in Cyber:
- Reading logs
- Finding suspicious files
- Analyzing permissions or process behavior
- Running scripts or tools (like Nmap, Wireshark)

## 🗃️ SQL (Structured Query Language)

- SQL is used to communicate with and manage data in relational databases.

### Key SQL Commands:
- `SELECT` – Retrieve data
- `FROM` – Identify the table
- `WHERE` – Filter results
- `ORDER BY` – Sort results
- `LIMIT` – Set number of results
- `JOIN` – Combine data across tables

### Cybersecurity Applications:
- Investigating security logs stored in databases
- Searching for indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Detecting anomalous user behavior (e.g., multiple failed logins)

---

## 🔍 Real-World Applications

- Linux and SQL are used together in many tools, including:
  - SIEM platforms
  - Vulnerability scanners
  - Threat detection systems

---

## 🧠 Career Takeaways

- Comfort with Linux and SQL sets candidates apart in cyber job markets.
- These skills are especially critical for SOC analysts, incident responders, and security engineers.
