Course 7: Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python
This course explores how Python can be used to automate repetitive cybersecurity tasks like log parsing, policy enforcement, and vulnerability scanning. It also covers essential Python concepts such as variables, loops, functions, working with files, and regular expressions.

⚙️ Why Automate with Python?
Reduces manual effort and speeds up processes

Helps security teams find threats earlier

Ensures consistency across tasks (like policy enforcement or compliance checks)

Supports a DevSecOps culture – security built into CI/CD pipelines

🧰 Key Python Concepts for Automation
Variables – Store and reuse data

Conditional statements – Run code only if certain conditions are met (if, else, elif)

Loops (iterative statements) – Repeat tasks using for or while loops

Functions – Reusable blocks of code; can take inputs (parameters) and return results

Lists and strings – Common data types for logs, usernames, IPs, etc.

Methods – Built-in functions tied to data types like .append(), .remove(), .split(), .join(), .index()

📂 Working with Files
Use open() with r, w, or a modes to read, write, or append

Read files into Python using .read(), then parse them with .split()

Write or update files with .write() after converting lists back to strings with .join()

Automate log reviews, allow list updates, and device tracking by manipulating .txt or .csv files

🧪 Regular Expressions (regex)
Useful for pattern matching in logs (e.g., extracting IPs or usernames)

re.findall() finds all matches to a pattern

Common symbols:

\w – Alphanumeric character (and underscore)

\d – Digit

. – Any character

+, *, {n} – Quantifiers for repetitions

🐞 Debugging
Syntax errors – Typos or improper structure (e.g., missing colons or parentheses)

Logic errors – Code runs but doesn’t behave as intended

Exceptions – Errors during execution (e.g., NameError, IndexError, TypeError)

Strategies:

Use print statements to trace variable values

Use debuggers and breakpoints in IDEs

🔐 Python in DevSecOps / CI/CD Pipelines
Automate:

SAST, DAST, and SCA scanning

Secrets management

Policy enforcement

Vulnerability scanning

Code quality checks

Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI can run Python scripts during deployment
