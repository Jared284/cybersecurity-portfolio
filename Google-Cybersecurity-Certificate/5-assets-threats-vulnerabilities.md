# Course 5: Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

This course focuses on identifying assets that need protection, understanding threats that can exploit vulnerabilities, and how cybersecurity professionals assess and prioritize these risks.

## 💎 What Are Assets?

- **Assets** are anything valuable to an organization that must be protected.
- Examples:
  - **Hardware** – Servers, computers, routers
  - **Software** – Applications, operating systems

  - Nation-states
  - Hacktivists
  - Insider threats
  - Script kiddies (amateurs using prebuilt tools)

## 🧱 Vulnerabilities

- **Vulnerabilities** are weaknesses in systems that can be exploited.
- Examples:
  - Outdated software
  - Misconfigured settings
  - Weak passwords
  - Poor access control

---

## ⚖️ Prioritizing Risk

- Use **Risk Assessment** to determine which vulnerabilities pose the highest risk.
- Formula: **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**
- Tools like **vulnerability scanners** help identify system weaknesses.

---

## 🔧 Common Vulnerability Management Tools

- **Nessus** – Vulnerability scanning
- **OpenVAS** – Open-source vulnerability scanning
- **Qualys** – Cloud-based vulnerability management
- **Shodan** – Search engine for internet-connected devices

---

## 🔐 Controls to Reduce Risk

- **Preventive**: Firewalls, MFA, encryption
- **Detective**: IDS, SIEM, file integrity monitoring
- **Corrective**: Patching, backups, recovery plans
